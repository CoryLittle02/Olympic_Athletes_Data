# Olympic_Athletes_Data
This is a python program to anaylze the athletes in the 2016 olympics and the 2020 olympics dataset. Check out the two datasets: 
2016 Olympics: https://www.kaggle.com/rio2016/olympic-games \
2020 Olympics: https://www.kaggle.com/aliaamiri/2020-summer-olympics-dataset?select=2020_Olympics_Dataset.csv \
In this program, we made functions to see if there were athletes that participate in both olympics. Once we were able to accomplish that, we created special case to see that athlete participate for a different countries or not. Also, we checked if the atheletes played in a different sport or not. 
## Files
olympics_wrangling.py contains the main script of aggregating both datasets of athletes.

## Usage 
To complete the task in our program was using HumanParser and FuzzyMatching. \
